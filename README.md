Technical exercise: 
Our tech stack is NextJS frontend + Python / gRPC backend + firebase auth/db + gcloud hosting.Given that information, could you complete this coding challenge?

The task is to create a NextJS + react webpage (using shadcn components, tanstack table) to display a table containing a repeated ResourceWrapper to the user: https://pastebin.com/vGpQz1va. The resources should be stored in firestore, and the frontend should be integrated with it.

This table should show key information like: resourceType, createdTime, fetchTime (relative to now). When the user clicks into the table, it should display the rest of the information, like the humanReadableStr, aiSummary.

Thereâ€™s no need to host the app on vercel etc, just sending the repository over will be fine.
